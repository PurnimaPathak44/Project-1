# Project-1

## Background

A new film company called "Rutgers" wants to produce a successful movie. In order to do that, they came across The Group-5 Data Analysis Company and provided them with a list of datasets that contains Movies information from 1962 to 2015. Based on these datasets, The Group-5 Agency’s task is to aggregate the data and find the trends that tend to show what factors are and are not responsible for a successful movie and present it to Rutgers to make strategic decisions regarding their production of movies.

## Defining a Successful Movie

The first thing The Group-5 Agency decided to do was define what a successful movie is by coming up with a list of success metrics.
- Box Office Revenue $
- Return on Investment (ROI)
- Movie Review Ratings (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic)
- Award Wins/Nominations
- Popularity

The Group-5 Agency performed analysis on all five of these success metrics. 

This provided Rutgers with multiple options for how they will produce their “successful movie”.
