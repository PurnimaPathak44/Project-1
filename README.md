Back Ground

A new company named Rutgers wants to produce a successful movie that generates good Revenue and hopes to win Oscars at the same time. 
In order to do that, they came across Group-5 Data Analysis Company and provided them with a list of datasets that contains Movies information from 1962 to 2015. Based on these datasets, The Group- 5 Agencyâ€™s task is to aggregate the data and find the trends that tend to show what factors are and are not responsible for a successful movie that generates high revenue and gets nominated for Oscars as well and present it to Rutgers to make strategic decisions regarding the production of movies.
